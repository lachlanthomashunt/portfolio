          <h2>This is a demonstration of the SQL codes I've generated in MySQL which generates and executes requests from the server.</h2>
            <section>
							<p>NOTE: The following code was forward engineered using MySQL and creates resources at the beginning of the script. In most cases, a database, schema and tables would already be created on a server and users/administators would access the database through <strong>VIEWS</strong>, which limit the destructive privileges users could use on the database.</p>
							<p>The code creates a relational database, meaning multiple tables hold data which the users can access and complex requests can return data to the user by referencing multiples tables in a single request. The user must have valid access and privileges to the database in order to carry out these requests. Requests are then sent to the database and returned to the user.</p>
							<h4>The code executes out the following instructions: </h4>
							<ul>
									<li>Sets some initial parameters,</li>
									<li>Drops the schema if it exists and creates a schema to use,</li>
									<li>Uses the database,</li>
									<li>Drops each table if it exists and creates each table, progressively adding the data types the tables will accept,</li>
									<li>Populates the tables with data,</li>
									<li>Generates the result a student scored via their studentID number,</li>
									<li>Generates the grades that have been scored in a specific subject,</li>
									<li>Generates the age of a student via their studentID,</li>
									<li>Generates the highest result from a student,</li>
									<li>Alters a table to add a column "Spoken Language at home",</li>
									<li>Alters a table to change the Subject Coordinator of a subject,</li>
									<li>Demonstrates how Procedures can be declared and then called to execute requests.</li>
